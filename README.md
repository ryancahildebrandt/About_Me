## *At a Glance*

Broadly, I'm an interdisciplinary researcher with interests in psycholinguistics, computational linguistics, statistics, and data science. More specifically, I work to apply statistical and data science methods to the problems in front of me. And if those problems relate to how we can leverage language to improve our lives and our understanding of the world, even better!
